This project simulates particle trajectories in the Mediterranean Sea and compares them with in-situ drifting buoy data.


This project involbez investigates the movement and dispersion of pollution in the Mediterranean Sea using a combination of observational data from drifting buoys and numerical particle simulations. The goal is to understand how pollutants travel over time and to compare simulated trajectories with real-world buoy measurements.
The project workflow includes Data Acquisition (in-situ drifting buoy data from the Copernicus Marine Service), resample the measurements to a daily interval to analyze average daily positions, simulating particle trajectories in the Mediterranean using velocity fields from oceanographic datasets, and comparing simulated trajectories with the observed buoy positions.
For visualization, plots showing buoy positions and trajectories, animated visualization of particle dispersion versus drifting buoy data, were generated.
